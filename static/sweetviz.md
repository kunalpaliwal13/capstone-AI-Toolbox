Machine learning has transformed industries, enabling data-driven decisions at an unprecedented scale. However, building robust models often requires significant expertise and time. This is where automated machine learning (AutoML) tools come into play, streamlining the entire process from data preprocessing to model selection and tuning.<br>

H2O AutoML is one such tool, offering an accessible yet powerful way to build machine learning models automatically. Despite its robust capabilities, newcomers might find it challenging to set up workflows or fully utilize its features. To address this, I created the Python H2O AutoML repository, which simplifies the adoption of H2O AutoML by offering an intuitive, modular framework.<br>

In this blog, we'll explore the repository's features, its use cases, and how it can help you get started with automated machine learning in no time.<br>

<h1>What is H2O AutoML?</h1><br>
H2O AutoML is an open-source framework that automates the machine learning workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation. With just a few lines of code, it performs:<br>

<h1>How to Use the Repository</h1><br>
<h2>1. Set Up Redis Database</h2><br>
If you haven't installed Redis yet, follow the official Redis installation guide to set it up on your system.<br>
Once Redis is running, navigate to the first tab in the application and update the connection details (host, port, and database) to match your Redis configuration, if necessary.<br>

<h2>2. Ingest Your Dataset</h2><br>
Upload your dataset or choose from five test datasets provided in the data folder:<br>
- Datasets 1 to 4: Simple datasets for quick testing with high accuracy.<br>
- Mock_data.csv: A realistic, mock-generated dataset for advanced testing. Note: achieving high accuracy on this dataset may not be feasible due to its complexity.<br>
Once uploaded, preview the dataset's structure and dimensions using the "Dataset Dimensions Form" to ensure it's ready for processing.<br>

<h2>3. Transform Your Dataset</h2><br>
- Apply transformations manually using H2O AutoML features.<br>
