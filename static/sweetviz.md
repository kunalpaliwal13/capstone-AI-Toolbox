<h3>Introduction to SweetViz</h3><br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science project. SweetViz is a Python library designed to automate EDA, providing visual and detailed insights into datasets with just a few lines of code.
This blog post explores the SweetViz-Python-Library repository, explaining its usage, features, and how you can leverage it for your data analysis needs.

<h3>Why Use SweetViz for EDA?</h3>
Manual EDA can be time-consuming, requiring multiple visualization and statistical functions. SweetViz simplifies this process by:
Generating a comprehensive HTML report in seconds.
- Providing visual comparisons between datasets.
- Automatically highlighting key statistics.
- Offering correlation insights and data imbalances.
- This makes it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced data scientists alike.

<h3>Features of SweetViz</h3>
SweetViz comes packed with features to streamline EDA:
- Automatic data profiling (mean, median, missing values, etc.).
- Correlation analysis using interactive visualizations.
- Comparison reports for train vs. test datasets.
- Feature distribution analysis with histograms and density plots.
- Target analysis to understand the impact of variables on the target column.

<h3>Installation and Setup</h3>
Setting up SweetViz is straightforward. Ensure you have Python installed and use the following commands:

- i. Clone the repository:<br>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/VITB-Tigers/SweetViz-Python-Library</pre>

- ii. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended). If using Conda:<br>
<pre>conda create -n env_name python==3.10.15 -y</pre>
<pre>conda activate env_name</pre>

- iii. Install dependencies:<br>
<pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>

<h3>Using SweetViz for Data Analysis</h3>
SweetViz works seamlessly with pandas DataFrames. Below is an example usage:
- i. Start the Streamlit application:
<pre>streamlit run source/app.py</pre>

- ii. Access the web interface at http://localhost:8501

- iii. Upload your CSV dataset and generate EDA reports!
