<h1>Introduction to Supervised Learning</h1>
Supervised learning is a fundamental machine learning technique where a model learns from labeled training data to make predictions on new data. It is widely used in tasks like spam detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis.
The Supervised-Classifiers repository provides implementations of various supervised learning algorithms, making it easier to understand and apply them in real-world scenarios.

<h1>Why Use Supervised Classifiers?</h1>
Supervised classifiers are essential in predictive modeling due to their ability to:
- Learn from labeled data and generalize well to new instances.
- Handle complex decision-making tasks such as fraud detection and medical diagnostics.
- Provide interpretability with algorithms like decision trees and logistic regression.
- Achieve high accuracy when trained with the right data and tuned properly.
This repository provides ready-to-use implementations for various classifiers, allowing users to quickly experiment and compare different models.

<h1>Overview of Supervised Learning Algorithms</h1>
Some popular Supervised Learning algorithms are:

<h2>1. Logistic Regression</h2>
A statistical model used for binary classification problems, such as spam detection.

<h2>2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)</h2>
A powerful classifier that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate classes.

<h2>3. Decision Trees</h2>
A flowchart-like structure used to make decisions based on feature values.

<h2>4. Random Forest</h2>
An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy and generalization.

<h2>5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</h2>
A simple instance-based learning algorithm that classifies new data based on similarity with training examples.

<h2>6. Na√Øve Bayes</h2>
A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, often used in text classification tasks.

<h2>7. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)</h2>
Powerful ensemble methods that improve prediction accuracy by sequentially reducing errors.

<h1>Installation and Setup</h1>

<h2>i. Clone the repository:</h2>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/VITB-Tigers/Supervised-Classifiers
</pre>

<h2>ii. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended). If using Conda:</h2>
<pre>
conda create -n env_name python==3.11.5 -y
conda activate env_name
</pre>

</pre>

<h1>Implementing Supervised Classifiers</h1>
Each classifier in the repository is implemented in Python using scikit-learn and other ML libraries.

<h2>Training a Ridge Classifier Model</h2>
![alt text](/static/image-6.png)<br>
<pre>
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RidgeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
print("Accuracy:", model.score(X_test, y_test))
</pre>

The repository provides similar implementations for Gaussian Naive Bayes, allowing users to experiment and compare their performance.

<h1>Evaluating Model Performance</h1>
![alt text](/static/image-7.png)<br>
To assess model performance, the repository includes evaluation metrics such as:
- Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.
- Precision and Recall: Useful in imbalanced datasets to evaluate false positives and false negatives.
- F1-Score: A balance between precision and recall.
- Cross Validation Score: Evaluate a score by cross-validation.

<h2>Evaluating a Model's Performance</h2>
<pre>
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
</pre>

<h1>Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization</h1>
To improve model performance, hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Grid Search and Randomized Search can be applied.

<h2>Example: Tuning a Random Forest Model</h2>
<pre>
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, 30]
}

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Best Parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Best Score:", grid_search.best_score_)
</pre>
