<br><h1>Building a Local RAG System with Mistral LLM</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
In the ever-evolving world of AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a game-changing approach to intelligent question-answering. By integrating a robust retrieval mechanism with powerful language models, RAG systems provide more contextually relevant responses than traditional models alone.
This blog explores how to build a local RAG system using Mistral LLM, enabling document processing and interactive Q&A‚Äîall within your personal computing environment. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a researcher, or a developer, this guide will help you set up a streamlined, privacy-focused AI assistant.

<h1>Key Features</h1>
Our RAG system offers a suite of functionalities designed for seamless document-based interaction:
- üìö Local document processing ‚Äì Supports PDF, TXT, and DOCX files
- üîç Intelligent text chunking and embedding ‚Äì Efficiently structures documents for retrieval
- üí° Context-aware question answering ‚Äì Generates precise responses based on document content
- üéØ Customizable response parameters ‚Äì Fine-tune the system for specific use cases
- üñ•Ô∏è User-friendly Streamlit interface ‚Äì Easy-to-use web app for interacting with documents

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
Before diving in, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Ollama with the Mistral model

<h1>Setting Up the Environment</h1>
Follow these steps to get your RAG system up and running:

<h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies</h2>
First, clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
<pre>
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
</pre>

<h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment</h2>
Using Conda:
<pre>
conda create --name rag_env python=3.12 -y
conda activate rag_env
</pre>
Or using venv:
<pre>
python -m venv rag_env
source rag_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
rag_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
</pre>

<h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Packages</h2>
<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

<h2>4Ô∏è‚É£ Install the Mistral Model in Ollama</h2>
<pre>
ollama pull mistral
</pre>

<h1>Using the RAG System</h1>
Once setup is complete, launch the Streamlit application:
<pre>
streamlit run stmain.py
</pre>
Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the system.

<h2>Basic Workflow:</h2>

<h2>Documents Page</h2>
The Documents tab serves as the entry point for uploading files into the system for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Users can upload various document formats from their local machine, which will then be processed and indexed for interaction in the Chat tab.
Key Features:
- Upload Section ‚Äì Allows users to select and upload documents from their computer.
- File List ‚Äì Displays uploaded documents with options to view, delete, or reprocess them.
- Status Indicators ‚Äì Shows the processing status of each document (e.g., "Processing," "Ready for Chat").
- Supported Formats ‚Äì Specifies allowed file types such as PDFs, text files, and Word documents.

<h2>Chat Page</h2>
The Chat tab is the main interface where users can interact with their uploaded documents. The system leverages the RAG approach to retrieve and synthesize relevant information from the uploaded files.
Key Features:
- Chat Interface ‚Äì A text input area for users to ask questions related to the uploaded documents.
- Response Window ‚Äì Displays AI-generated responses based on document retrieval.
- Document Context Awareness ‚Äì The chatbot fetches relevant information from the uploaded files.
- Follow-up Queries ‚Äì Allows users to refine questions and receive more precise responses.

<h2>Settings Page</h2>
The Settings tab provides control over key parameters affecting the model's response generation.
Key Features:
- Temperature Adjustment ‚Äì Controls the randomness of responses.
  - Lower values (e.g., 0.2) result in more deterministic and factual responses.
  - Higher values (e.g., 0.8) generate more creative and diverse answers.
- Context Window Size ‚Äì Defines how much previous conversation history is considered in generating responses.
  - Smaller windows focus on the most recent exchanges.
  - Larger windows allow for a broader context, ensuring long-term coherence.

<h1>Project Structure</h1>
The project follows a modular design for easy scalability:
- pysrc/ ‚Äì Core Python scripts for document processing, embeddings, and retrieval.
- stmain.py ‚Äì Streamlit app entry point.
- Info.md ‚Äì Technical documentation.
- LearnWithPrompts.md ‚Äì Example prompts and learning guide.

<h1>Learning Resources</h1>
New to RAG systems? Here are some helpful resources:
- Read LearnWithPrompts.md for guided tutorials.
- Explore Info.md for in-depth technical insights.
- Experiment with the example prompts provided in the documentation.

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
Encountering issues? Try these solutions:

<h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Ollama Connection Error</h2>
- Ensure Ollama is running locally.
- Verify that the Mistral model is installed properly.

<h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Document Processing Issues</h2>
- Check if the file format is supported (PDF, TXT, DOCX).
- Ensure the file is not corrupted.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
By integrating Mistral LLM into a RAG-based workflow, we create an intelligent, local-first AI assistant that enhances information retrieval and question-answering capabilities. This system is ideal for researchers, businesses, and AI enthusiasts looking to leverage powerful language models while maintaining data privacy.
